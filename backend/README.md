# DhruvSetu backend

The backend uses FastAPI and runs locally.

## Set up

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Start the API

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The API runs at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).
API documentation is available at
[http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs).

## Run the test

The database tests use the local MySQL container. Start it from the project
root before running the tests.

```bash
pytest
```

## Database

Start MySQL from the project root:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Run migrations from this backend folder:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

Check the live database connection at
[http://127.0.0.1:8000/health/database](http://127.0.0.1:8000/health/database).

## Demo data

Add the small prototype dataset after migrations are current:

```bash
python -m app.seed
```

The seed is safe to run again. It keeps the same demo records and does not
delete other data. All seeded content is clearly marked as demo or prototype
data and must not be treated as real scientific information.

## Semantic search

Semantic search finds records with related meaning. It uses a small local model
and does not need an API key. Build or rebuild the local index from MySQL:

```bash
python -m app.search.build_index
```

Then start the API normally with `uvicorn app.main:app --reload` and start the
frontend with `npm run dev` from the `frontend` folder. On the search page,
choose **Keyword** for MySQL text search or **Semantic** for related meanings.
Generated model-cache and index files stay outside Git.

## Source documents

The ingestion command supports UTF-8 TXT files and text-based PDFs. It keeps
the original file on disk, stores source metadata and chunks in MySQL, and uses
a SHA-256 file hash to prevent duplicates.

```bash
python -m app.ingestion.ingest /path/to/source.txt --title "Source title"
```

Optional flags can connect the source to an existing record:

```bash
python -m app.ingestion.ingest /path/to/source.pdf \
  --title "Source title" \
  --source-type "research_report" \
  --report-id "existing-report-id"
```

Add the three small prototype documents used by the project:

```bash
python -m app.ingestion.seed_demo
```

Rebuild the local semantic index after ingesting documents so their chunks are
available to source retrieval:

```bash
python -m app.search.build_index
```

The prototype does not use OCR, accept public uploads, call an LLM, or generate
answers. Source retrieval returns original text chunks for later RAG work.

## Sources and verification

Every document keeps its source details: title, source type, file type, page
numbers, original source URL, publication date, and links to a related
expedition, publication, or report. The documents API, the expedition detail
API, and assistant sources all return these details from MySQL. Missing
details are returned as empty values and are never filled in.

Verification status is one of:

- `uploaded` - added to the repository but not yet reviewed (the default)
- `reviewed` - checked by a person
- `verified` - source details and content confirmed for the prototype

Set the status when ingesting a document. Ingestion never marks a document as
reviewed or verified on its own.

```bash
python -m app.ingestion.ingest /path/to/source.pdf \
  --title "Source title" \
  --source-url "https://example.org/source.pdf" \
  --verification-status reviewed
```

The source URL must start with `http://` or `https://`. Demo data is a separate
flag (`--demo`) and does not replace the verification status.

## AI assistant

The assistant answers questions using source chunks from the repository. It
calls `retrieve_source_chunks()`, sends the best matching chunks to Claude, and
returns the answer with its sources.

Add these values to the `.env` file in the project root. Never commit the real
key.

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
ANTHROPIC_MODEL=
```

`ANTHROPIC_MODEL` is optional. When it is empty the assistant uses
`claude-opus-5-5`. Without an API key the endpoint returns
`AI assistant is not configured.` and the rest of DhruvSetu keeps working.

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/assistant/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What does the sea ice observation plan record?"}'
```

Weak matches are not sent to Claude. Tune the cut-off with
`ASSISTANT_MIN_SCORE` (default `0.35`). The frontend page is at `/assistant`.
